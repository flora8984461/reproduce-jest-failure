There is some open issue in vite and fluentui:
https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/issues/25547
https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/issues/24952
https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/2433

It happens when I add @fluentui/react-icons. After taking a look at the open issue, seems I can skip generating sourcemap for @fluentui/react-icons. I am not sure if there is an option to set playwright to do that when it bundles.
